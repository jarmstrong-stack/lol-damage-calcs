# lol-damage-calcs

A prospective toolkit for experimenting with League of Legends itemization and damage calculations.

## Project status

This repository currently hosts planning notes only. The calculation engine, data refresh scripts, user interfaces, and automated
tests described in the accompanying pull request are still under development and have not been committed yet. Until those
artifacts land, there is no installable Python package, no CLI module, and no web UI to run.

## Getting involved

If you would like to contribute code or documentation once the implementation is published:

1. Open an issue describing the feature or bugfix you intend to work on.
2. Coordinate on scope to avoid duplicate effort while the initial version is being built.
3. Submit a pull request when the relevant modules have been pushed to the repository.
